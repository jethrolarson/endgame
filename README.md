Premise: MMOs basically boil down to optimizing the filling up or emptying of bars. Can you remove everything that's not the core gameplay of an MMO and have a good experience.

Features
-------------
* Start at level 100, and can't go up levels
- Character progression occurs though completing tutorials(which is optional)
* The whole game is an api.

Core Gameplay
-------------
You control one character in a MMO like WoW. 

Initial prototype will be single player.
