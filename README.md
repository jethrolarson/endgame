Premise: MMOs basically boil down to optimizing the filling up or emptying of bars. Can you remove everything that's not the core gameplay of an MMO and have a good experience.

Features
-------------
* Free to play/Micro-transaction
* Everyone starts at level 100, and can't go up levels
- Character progression occurs though completing tutorials(which is optional)
* The whole game is an api.
* Openly encourage moding and the use of mods
* Use heuristics to ferret out cheating.
