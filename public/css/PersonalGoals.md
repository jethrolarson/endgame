Create something that only requires 4 hours of weekly maintenance and generates $10,000 profit per month

$6k is for me
$4k reinvested

We find ways to do what we need to. So lets manufacture the need. 

I want to be more involved in theatre, music, art. With the kids, with the wife, with friends. I can't do this and spend 50 hours a week working for someone else.

Need to make money selling something that I don't have to produce myself, or a digital product. 
WordPress themes, widgets, guides, cheatsheets, infographics.
This means at least 60% marketing.

Take my site theme, turn it into a tumblr theme and create a mobile version to go with it.

Maybe an wordpress plugin for art portfolios or galleries?

Real Estate CMS?
